# BOLT

Bolt is a go program that generates the scaffolding for a web app using a 
component based architecture. It also generates server code and other files that
are useful for rapid prototyping and development.

NOTE: Bolt is under heavy development and is still considered beta. 

The structure of a bolt app looks like this:

    > .
         ├── internal
         │   ├── components
         │   │   ├── footer
         │   │   │   ├── footer.css
         │   │   │   ├── footer.js
         │   │   │   └── footer.tmpl
         │   │   └── head
         │   │       └── head.tmpl
         │   ├── pages
         │   │   └── main
         │   │       └── main.tmpl
         │   └── shared
         │       ├── css
         │       │   └── main.css
         │       └── js
         │           └── main.js
         ├── public
         │   └── media
         ├── autoload.sh
         ├── bolt_conf.json
         ├── Dockerfile
         ├── globals.go
         ├── handlers.go
         ├── helpers.go
         ├── logging.go
         ├── main.go
         ├── restart-service.sh
         ├── server.go
         └── viewdata.go
         
         12 directories, 18 files

A bolt app is composed of html templates called `pages` and `components`. `pages`
are typically composed of components, and components can also be composed of
other components. 

Bolt will also generate some basic server code and build files to begin the 
process of rapid prototyping and development. 

By running the following, we can visit the website generated by the previous 
command:

    ./autoload boltapp 9001
    Server started @ http://localhost:9001

Visit `localhost:9001` in your web browser and you should see the following:

Components are stored in `/internal/components`
